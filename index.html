      <h2>Dr. Ben Sheikh</h2>
      <p>
        Tewhida Ben Sheikh January 2, 1909 in Tunis â€“ December 6, 2010)
        was the first modern Tunisian woman in North Africa to become a physician.
        She was also a pioneer in women's medicine, in particular contraception
        and abortion access.
      </p>
      <h2>Early years</h2>
      <p>Tewhida Ben Sheikh was born in Tunis, Tunisia. Her early education was at Tunisia's first public school for Muslim
        girls, which was established by "Tunisian nationalists and liberal French protectorate authorities". While attending
        this school, Ben Sheikh was taught Arabic, French, the study of the Qur'an, and modern subjects. She travelled to the
        School of Medicine in Paris to pursue her education, earning a degree in medicine in 1936. Upon her return to Tunis,
        she was given a dinner in her honour by local doctors.
        Tunisia was a French colony at the time. Ben Sheikh came from an elite Tunisian family which was socially conservative,
        and her widowed mother was reluctant to allow her to go to France after secondary school; however, her secondary school
        instructors and a doctor from the Louis Pasteur Institute of Tunis (Dr. Etienne Burnet), persuaded Ben Sheikh's mother
        that she showed significant promise.</p>
      <h2>Professional achievements</h2>
      <p>Specializing in gynecology, Ben Sheikh directed a women's clinic in Tunisia. Ben Sheikh was an "active" supporter
        of family planning; in the 1960s and 1970s, she instructed doctors in abortion procedures.</p>
      <h2>Legacy</h2>
      <p>In March 2020, Dr. Ben Sheikh featured on the new 10-dinar banknote issued by the Central Bank of Tunisia.
        On 27 March 2021, Google celebrated her with a Google Doodle.</p>
